# (͡ ͡° ͜ つ ͡͡°) Discord Bot

## GOKZ Commands in Discord

If you have any bugs to report or suggestions to make I would appreaciate it!
Feel free to message me on Discord: `AlphaKeks#7480`
I'm always happy about constructive criticism; toxicity is unnecessary and will be ignored :)

This Bot is a personal project of mine and I don't intend to get this on as many servers as possible. I published it to get feedback and provide people with the features of this bot as I haven't seen a similar one on any KZ Discord I am on. If you have a different bot you like more, that's fine by me!
